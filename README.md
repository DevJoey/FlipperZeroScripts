## Passworder

Imagine you want to create an account on the YouTube website on a school PC or a friend's computer. Now you have the problem that you need a secure password. 
You would need to write it down for later. This is where Passworder comes in. Passworder generates a secure password for you and stores it on your Flipper Zero. 
You can later easily retrieve it and, for example, transfer it to your password manager. Passworder also gives you the option to directly paste the generated 
password into the text field. In this case, Passworder simulates a regular keyboard.
